**Classification of lung cancer prediction**

Lung cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, necessitating early and accurate predictive methodologies. This study evaluates the efficacy of six distinct classification algorithms in predicting lung cancer based on a set of predictor variables: Age, Smokes, AreaQ, and Alkhol. The algorithms utilized include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). We conducted a comparative analysis to assess each algorithm's performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Data were preprocessed to handle missing values, scale features, and encode categorical variables. The results indicate significant variability in the performance of these algorithms, with Random Forest and SVM showing the highest predictive accuracy. Our findings suggest that combining patient demographic and lifestyle factors with machine learning techniques can significantly enhance lung cancer prediction, potentially leading to earlier interventions and improved patient outcomes. The study also discusses the implications of feature importance derived from the models, providing insights into the relative impact of each predictor variable on lung cancer risk.
